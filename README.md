# pdfslicer
simple tool for slicing pages out of pdfs to new pdfs

create a pages.csv with page numbers on lines, 1 per line
edit variables at the top of Makefile as required
make

## doing this as a loop
an example of this as a single loop is in as_loop.tex. if the splits are _very_ large this may be necessary.
